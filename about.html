                    <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Xavier. I'm learning front-end engineering course in Codecademy. It's my first published website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have learnt front-end web development for 8 months. It's really challenging and funny! 
                Tell you a secret. When I was a high school student, I hated computer course the most as the teacher was super boring. 
                However, I love it when I'm self-learning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm a slasher. A junior front-end developer/ social worker/ educator/ piano tutor. I like to explore 
                and learn new skills. My motto is "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."</p>
